Deno Solid - "pick-a-rick"

this is page is live [https://pick-a-rick.deno.dev](https://pick-a-rick.deno.dev/#)

I'm making a web framework and getting into streaming so Wubalubadubdub

Using deno, solidjs, unocss, urql, graphql, fauna

getting data from the rick and morty api


The server implementation for solid is in /utils, this is compiling solid with every request (for now)

Eventually aims to become a very narrow use-case meta-framework but this is an experiment.
